The State Department Should Embrace Its New Wikileaks Cablegate Transparency<br><br>

在很多人眼里，美国国务院的工作像其他官僚机构的工作那样单调无聊――整天忙于为护照盖章和审查签证申请――“维基解密”网站上泄露出的一些有趣的电报，可能会改变这一印象。<br><br>
美国国务院不满意“维基解密”让其机密或绝密电报在互联网上公开，但时光无法倒流，所以它应该接受“维基解密”为其带来的新透明度。<br><br>

	大规模泄密带来的负面影响是什么？在昨天的新闻发布会上，美国国务院称，泄密“带来了冲击”，危及到一些人的生命，而且让美国政府感到相当尴尬。美国国务院一位官员表示，这是“美国外交史上艰难的一周”。例如，据“维基解密”透露，俄罗斯总理普京也被冒犯，他奇怪地被比作为“蝙蝠侠”。而美国大使馆的工作人员被要求从事一些间谍活动，具体而言，2009年他们曾收到命令，收集外国高官的DNA和生物数据，以及通信时所使用的密码、信用卡号和经常使用的航空会员账号信息联系等。等等，别大惊小怪了，爆出外交官涉足间谍活动这样的内幕，只能令那些没有读过约翰 卡雷（John le Carré，英国间谍小说家）小说的人大跌眼镜。<br><br>

	像一盘广为流传的性录像带中的受害者，美国国务院要求惩罚相关责任人，不让人们看到他们亲密的时刻。奇怪的是，美国国务院要求其雇员不要登录“维基解密”网站。但这一要求似乎使他们的工作变得更为艰难，因为他们不知道国外同行们从“维基解密”网站上了解到了什么，从而使他们更难对“维基解密”网站造成的损害进行控制。<br><br>

	而艾琳 安德鲁（Erin Andrews，ESPN体育记者，连续两年被《花花公子》杂志评选为“最性感体育记者”，被传遭到偷拍）肯定会以自己的经验告诉他们，私人的东西一旦被传出去了，就没有办法阻止它的传播。因此，还是让我们从正面看待透明度被提高带来的效应。“维基解密”对于美国国务院带来的效果，类似于《《壮志凌云》（Top Gun，又译作“捍卫战士”，是一部空战名片）对于美国空军的效果 ――激发年轻人的向往之情。受到“维基解密”曝光的美国国务院，是自前国务卿赖斯在德国威斯巴登以一双齐膝高的黑色长筒靴子亮相后最性感的时候……<br><br>

	在很多人眼里，美国国务院的工作像其他官僚机构的工作那样单调无聊――整天忙于为护照盖章和审查签证申请――“维基解密”网站上泄露出的一些有趣的电报，可能会改变这一印象。<br><br>

	Slate.com在线杂志专栏作家克里斯托弗 比姆（Christopher Beam）好奇地问道：“如果普利策奖评奖委员会(Pulitzer Board)读到这些东西会怎样呢？”曝光的密报揭示了一个令人兴奋的外交世界。比姆写道：“一些密报显示，外交活动充满了刺激、心理战等等。”
<br><br>
	在密报披露的细节中，我最感兴趣的是对英国安德鲁王子出席一次早午餐会的描述。这次早午餐会发生的时间是2008年，地点是吉尔吉斯斯坦比什凯克市。在这次早午餐会上，安德鲁王子和其他高级别官员感叹吉尔吉斯的商业文化充满了腐败。美国驻吉尔吉斯大使这样写道：<br><br>

	王子再次陷入深思，自言自语道，外人可能无助于改变这里的腐败文化。“他们自己要有改变的意向。就像厌食症，你只有靠自己才能治愈好。而别人无法代劳。”<br><br>

	据这位大使描述，安德鲁王子将注意力转到记者犯下的错误，以及美国和英国政府犯下的错误。这些描述给我的震憾如同伊夫林 沃（Evelyn Waugh，英国作家）笔下的小说情节：<br><br>

	（安德鲁王子）接着说：“这些（该死的）记者，特别是来自《卫报》的，到处多管闲事”，（大意）使英国商人更难做生意。实际上，周围的人群为之鼓掌。<br><br>

	然后，他以一个出人意料的话结束了他的演讲。他严厉地责骂道：我们愚蠢（原文如此）的英国和美国政府充其量只能做好十年的计划，而生活在这个地方的人做好了长达一个世纪的计划。”在这家私人的早午餐厅，不时听到有人喊道“听，听”。由于东拉西扯了这些有关英国的话题，他们令人尊敬的王子不能及时赶赴与（吉尔吉斯斯坦）总理的会见。他很遗憾地要离开参加这次早午餐会的宾客，他们也同样感到遗憾。走出餐厅的时候，有人悄悄告诉这位大使：“作为英国人民的代表，王子真是了不起！我们不得不为我们的皇室自豪！<br><br>

	看来，美国国务院里全是小说家。<br><br>

The State Department isn’t happy about having its confidential, top-secret cables blasted across the Internet by Wikileaks, but there’s no going back now, so it should embrace its new transparency.<br><br>

	What are the downsides of the massive leak? In its press briefing yesterday, the State Department said the release “has had an impact,” putting lives at risk, and generally embarrassing the U.S. gov. It’s been a “rough week for American diplomacy,” says one official. For example, Vladimir Putin was strangely offended at being compared to Batman. And it was revealed that embassy employees are expected to do some spying; specifically, they were ordered in 2009 to gather DNA and biometric data, as well as contact, credit card, and frequent flyer intel from their frenemies abroad. But come now, the fact that diplomats dabble in spying can only be a surprise to those who don’t read John le Carré novels.<br><br>

	Like a victim of a sex tape gone viral, the State Department wants to punish the person responsible and keep people from seeing their intimate moments. Strangely, State Department employees have been told not to surf the Wikileaks site. That would seem to make their jobs harder as they won’t know what their diplomatic counterparts are seeing, thus making it more difficult for them to do damage control.<br><br>

	As Erin Andrews could certainly tell them, once something private is out, there’s no stopping its spread. So let’s look at the upside of this forced transparency. Cablegate may be for the State Department what Top Gun was for the Air Force ― a great recruitment tool. This is the sexiest the State Department has been since then-Secretary of State Condi Rice strapped on knee-high black boots in Wiesbaden…<br><br>

	Anyone who thought of working for the State Department primarily as a bureaucratic bore ― days filled with stamping passports and reviewing visa applications ― will likely have their minds changed by some of the charming cables that have emerged from the document dump on the Wikileaks site.<br><br>

	&nbsp;Christopher Beam at Slate wonders “if the Pulitzer Board is reading this stuff.” The cables reveal an exciting diplomatic world. “The best cables show diplomacy in action, mind games and all,” writes Beam.<br><br>

	My favorite cable details a brunch meeting with Prince Andrew in 2008 in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, where the Duke of York and other high level officials lamented the corrupt Kyrgyz business culture. Writes the diplomat:<br><br>

	Again turning thoughtful, the Prince mused that outsiders could do little to change the culture of corruption here. “They themselves have to have a change of heart. Just like you have to cure yourself of anorexia. No one else can do it for you.”<br><br>

	The diplomat’s description of Prince Andrew turning his attention to what’s wrong with journalists, as well as the U.S. and U.K. governments, struck me as something out of an Evelyn Waugh novel:<br><br>

	[Prince Andrew] then went on to “these (expletive) journalists, especially from the National Guardian, who poke their noses everywhere” and (presumably) make it harder for British businessmen to do business. The crowd practically clapped.<br><br>

	He then capped this off with a zinger: castigating “our stupid (sic) British and American governments which plan at best for ten years whereas people in this part of the world plan for centuries.” There were calls of “hear, hear” in the private brunch hall. Unfortunately for the assembled British subjects, their cherished Prince was now late to the Prime Minister’s. He regretfully tore himself away from them and they from him. On the way out, one of them confided to the Ambassador: “What a wonderful representative for the British people! We could not be prouder of our royal family!”<br><br>

Aspiring novelists, the State Department calls.<br><br>

The United States of America has gone mad  《泰晤士报》<br><br>


Published on Wednesday, January 15, 2003 by the Times/UK <br><br> 
by John le Carré （约翰.勒卡雷）原名大卫.康威尔，1931年生於英国。18岁时，便被英国军方情报单位招募，担任对东柏林的间谍工作；退役后在牛津大学攻读现代语言，之后於伊顿公学教授法文与德文。1959年，进入英国外交部工作，先后於英国驻波昂及汉堡的大使馆服务，同时开始写作。1963年，以第三本著作《冷战谍魂》（The Spy who came in from the cold）一举成名，被知名小说家葛林盛说U「这是我读过最好的间谍小说！」从此奠定文坛大师地位。<br><br>

America has entered one of its periods of historical madness, but this is the worst I can remember: worse than McCarthyism, worse than the Bay of Pigs and in the long term potentially more disastrous than the Vietnam War. <br><br>

美国已经进入了一段疯狂的历史时期，这是我能记起的最糟糕的一次，超过麦卡锡主义、超过猪湾事件，其潜在危险比越南战争更具灾难性。<br><br>

The reaction to 9/11 is beyond anything Osama bin Laden could have hoped for in his nastiest dreams. As in McCarthy times, the freedoms that have made America the envy of the world are being systematically eroded. The combination of compliant US media and vested corporate interests is once more ensuring that a debate that should be ringing out in every town square is confined to the loftier columns of the East Coast press.<br><br> 

9・11袭击事件的反应远远超出了奥萨马・本・拉丹恶毒的梦想，就像在麦卡锡主义时代，美国那种为世界所嫉妒的自由正在被有系统地侵蚀。
<br><br>
The imminent war was planned years before bin Laden struck, but it was he who made it possible. Without bin Laden, the Bush junta would still be trying to explain such tricky matters as how it came to be elected in the first place; Enron; its shameless favouring of the already-too-rich; its reckless disregard for the world’s poor, the ecology and a raft of unilaterally abrogated international treaties. They might also have to be telling us why they support Israel in its continuing disregard for UN resolutions. <br><br>

正在迫近的这场战 争（指美国对伊动武）早在本・拉丹袭击发生的几年前就计划好了，拉丹不过是让这场战争变成了可能。没有他，布什集团仍然会想方设法解释那些骗人的把戏，比如他如何当选美国总统、比如安然丑闻等等。他们可能还要告诉我们为什么他们支持以色列继续无视联合国决议。<br><br>

But bin Laden conveniently swept all that under the carpet. The Bushies are riding high. Now 88 per cent of Americans want the war, we are told. The US defence budget has been raised by another $60 billion to around $360 billion. A splendid new generation of nuclear weapons is in the pipeline, so we can all breathe easy. Quite what war 88 per cent of Americans think they are supporting is a lot less clear. A war for how long, please? At what cost in American lives? At what cost to the American taxpayer’s pocket? At what cost ― because most of those 88 per cent are thoroughly decent and humane people ― in Iraqi lives? <br><br>

但是拉丹扫清了所有障碍。现在我们被告知，88％的美国人希望发生这场战争；美国的国防预算又增加了600亿美元，总数达到3600亿美元；新一代核武器 已经在运送途中，所以我们完全可以放宽心。但这88％的美国人所支持的是什么样的战争并不清楚。这场战争要打多久？要赔上多少美国人的性命？花掉美国纳税 人多少钱？又要夺走多少伊拉克人的生命？
<br><br>
How Bush and his junta succeeded in deflecting America’s anger from bin Laden to Saddam Hussein is one of the great public relations conjuring tricks of history. But they swung it. A recent poll tells us that one in two Americans now believe Saddam was responsible for the attack on the World Trade Centre. But the American public is not merely being misled. It is being browbeaten and kept in a state of ignorance and fear. The carefully orchestrated neurosis should carry Bush and his fellow conspirators nicely into the next election. 
<br><br>
而布什和他的集团成功地将美国人对拉丹的愤怒转移到萨达姆身上，则是历史上最厉害的公关骗术之一。最近的一项调查显示，两个美国人中就有一人相信萨达姆应 该对世贸中心的受袭负责。但是美国民众还不仅仅是被误导，他们被吓住了，处于一种无知和恐惧的状态。这种布什集团精心编排的神经症应该可以将布什送到下届选举。
<br><br>
Those who are not with Mr Bush are against him. Worse, they are with the enemy. Which is odd, because I’m dead against Bush, but I would love to see Saddam’s downfall ― just not on Bush’s terms and not by his methods. And not under the banner of such outrageous hypocrisy. 
<br><br>
The religious cant that will send American troops into battle is perhaps the most sickening aspect of this surreal war-to-be. Bush has an arm-lock on God. And God has very particular political opinions. God appointed America to save the world in any way that suits America. God appointed Israel to be the nexus of America’s Middle Eastern policy, and anyone who wants to mess with that idea is a) anti-Semitic, b) anti-American, c) with the enemy, and d) a terrorist. 
<br><br>
用以宗教名义说出的伪善之言将美国士兵送上战场，可能是这场即将发生的战争中最令人作呕的一面。布什“制服”了上帝，而上帝有着非常特殊的政治观点：上帝 指派美国用任何适合美国的方式去拯救世界；上帝指派以色列成为美国中东政策的连接点；任何反闪族、反美或是跟美国的敌人搅和在一起的人都是恐怖分子。
<br><br>
God also has pretty scary connections. In America, where all men are equal in His sight, if not in one another’s, the Bush family numbers one President, one ex-President, one ex-head of the CIA, the Governor of Florida and the ex-Governor of Texas. 
<br><br>
上帝还有一些非常令人恐慌的关系网，在他的眼中，人人平等的美国却出现了一个特例。在布什的大家庭里有一个总统、一个前总统、一个前中情局局长、一个佛罗 里达州州长和前得克萨斯州州长。
<br><br>
Care for a few pointers? George W. Bush, 1978-84: senior executive, Arbusto Energy/Bush Exploration, an oil company; 1986-90: senior executive of the Harken oil company. Dick Cheney, 1995-2000: chief executive of the Halliburton oil company. Condoleezza Rice, 1991-2000: senior executive with the Chevron oil company, which named an oil tanker after her. And so on. But none of these trifling associations affects the integrity of God’s work. 
<br><br>
再看看布什领导班子里的成员，从布什总统本人，到副总统切尼、国家安全顾问赖斯都曾是石油公司的高级主管，但这些关联竟然 都没有影响到上帝工作的正直性
<br><br>
In 1993, while ex-President George Bush was visiting the ever-democratic Kingdom of Kuwait to receive thanks for liberating them, somebody tried to kill him. The CIA believes that “somebody” was Saddam. Hence Bush Jr’s cry: “That man tried to kill my Daddy.” But it’s still not personal, this war. It’s still necessary. It’s still God’s work. It’s still about bringing freedom and democracy to oppressed Iraqi people. 
<br><br>
1993年，当前总统乔治・布什访问科威特试图从那里得到些感谢的话语时，有人差点暗杀了他。中情局认为“有人”指的就是萨达姆。从此小布什就叫喊着：“ 那个人试图杀了我爸爸！”在这样的情况下，这场战争仍然不算是个人的，仍然是必要的，仍然是上帝的工作，仍然被称作是要给受压迫的伊拉克人带来自由和民主。
<br><br>
To be a member of the team you must also believe in Absolute Good and Absolute Evil, and Bush, with a lot of help from his friends, family and God, is there to tell us which is which. What Bush won’t tell us is the truth about why we’re going to war. What is at stake is not an Axis of Evil ― but oil, money and people’s lives. Saddam’s misfortune is to sit on the second biggest oilfield in the world. Bush wants it, and who helps him get it will receive a piece of the cake. And who doesn’t, won’t. 
<br><br>
要想成为布什团队的一员，你必须信仰绝对的善良和绝对的邪恶，而布什，通过从他的朋友、家庭和上帝那里得到的帮助，告诉我们什么是什么。但是布什不肯告诉 我们的是战争的真相，危险的并不是邪恶轴心，而是石油、金钱和人们的生命。萨达姆的不幸便是坐在了世界上第二大的油田上面。布什想得到这个油田，谁愿意帮助他就可以从这里分得一杯羹，不愿意的就没有。
<br><br>
If Saddam didn’t have the oil, he could torture his citizens to his heart’s content. Other leaders do it every day ― think Saudi Arabia, think Pakistan, think Turkey, think Syria, think Egypt. 
<br><br>
Baghdad represents no clear and present danger to its neighbours, and none to the US or Britain. Saddam’s weapons of mass destruction, if he’s still got them, will be peanuts by comparison with the stuff Israel or America could hurl at him at five minutes’ notice. What is at stake is not an imminent military or terrorist threat, but the economic imperative of US growth. What is at stake is America’s need to demonstrate its military power to all of us ― to Europe and Russia and China, and poor mad little North Korea, as well as the Middle East; to show who rules America at home, and who is to be ruled by America abroad. 
<br><br>
The most charitable interpretation of Tony Blair’s part in all this is that he believed that, by riding the tiger, he could steer it. He can’t. Instead, he gave it a phoney legitimacy, and a smooth voice. Now I fear, the same tiger has him penned into a corner, and he can’t get out. 
<br><br>
对于布莱尔首相参与此事最仁慈的解释就是，他相信骑在老虎身上就可以掌握它。但是相反，他不能。
<br><br>
It is utterly laughable that, at a time when Blair has talked himself against the ropes, neither of Britain’s opposition leaders can lay a glove on him. But that’s Britain’s tragedy, as it is America’s: as our Governments spin, lie and lose their credibility, the electorate simply shrugs and looks the other way. Blair’s best chance of personal survival must be that, at the eleventh hour, world protest and an improbably emboldened UN will force Bush to put his gun back in his holster unfired. But what happens when the world’s greatest cowboy rides back into town without a tyrant’s head to wave at the boys? 
<br><br>
他能“活”下来的最好机会就是在战争即将打响的最后关头， 世界各地的抗议声和“勇敢”的联合国迫使布什将手中的枪放回枪套。但试想，让世界上最伟大的牛仔空手回到自己的镇上将会发生什么样的情况？
<br><br>
Blair’s worst chance is that, with or without the UN, he will drag us into a war that, if the will to negotiate energetically had ever been there, could have been avoided; a war that has been no more democratically debated in Britain than it has in America or at the UN. By doing so, Blair will have set back our relations with Europe and the Middle East for decades to come. He will have helped to provoke unforeseeable retaliation, great domestic unrest, and regional chaos in the Middle East. Welcome to the party of the ethical foreign policy. 
<br><br>
布莱尔最糟糕的选择就是，不管有没有联合国授权，他都会将我们拖入战争。
<br><br>
There is a middle way, but it’s a tough one: Bush dives in without UN approval and Blair stays on the bank. Goodbye to the special relationship. 
<br><br>
当然也存在一种中间选择，那就是布什在没有联合国批准的情况下开战，布莱尔在一旁 观战，彻底告别两国的特殊关系。但是这种选择将是困难的。
<br><br>
I cringe when I hear my Prime Minister lend his head prefect’s sophistries to this colonialist adventure. His very real anxieties about terror are shared by all sane men. What he can’t explain is how he reconciles a global assault on al-Qaeda with a territorial assault on Iraq. We are in this war, if it takes place, to secure the fig leaf of our special relationship, to grab our share of the oil pot, and because, after all the public hand-holding in Washington and Camp David, Blair has to show up at the altar. 
<br><br>
如果战争打响，我们将身处其中，为了维护我们的特殊关系，为了从油罐中得到我们的那一份。
<br><br>
“But will we win, Daddy?” 
<br><br>
“我们会赢吗，爸爸？”
<br><br>
“Of course, child. It will all be over while you’re still in bed.” 
<br><br>
“当然，孩子。当你还没睡醒时战争就结束了。
<br><br>
“Why?” 
<br><br>
“为什么？”
<br><br>
“Because otherwise Mr Bush’s voters will get terribly impatient and may decide not to vote for him.” 
<br><br>
“因为否则布什先生的选民就会变得非常不耐心，并且可能决定不再投票给他。”
<br><br>
“But will people be killed, Daddy?” 
<br><br>
“但是会有人被杀害吗，爸爸？”
<br><br>
“Nobody you know, darling. Just foreign people.” 
<br><br>
“没有你认识的人，亲爱的，只是些外国人。”
<br><br>
“Can I watch it on television?” 
<br><br>
“我能从电视上看到吗？”
<br><br>
“Only if Mr Bush says you can.”
<br><br>
“只有布什先生说可以的时候你才可以。”
<br><br>
“And afterwards, will everything be normal again? Nobody will do anything horrid any more?” 
<br><br>
“那么以后一切都会恢复正常吗？没有人会再做可怕的事情了吗？”
<br><br>
“Hush child, and go to sleep.” 
<br><br>
“安静，孩子，睡吧。”
<br><br>
Last Friday a friend of mine in California drove to his local supermarket with a sticker on his car saying: “Peace is also Patriotic”. It was gone by the time he’d finished shopping. 
<br><br>
上周五，我的一个美国朋友在加州开车去当地一个超市采购，他的汽车上贴着一条标语“和平也是爱国主义”，当他从超市出来时那则标语已经不见了。
