以下是王毅发言全文： <br><br>

主席先生： <br><br>

今年是中国发展进程中不平凡的一年。中国新一届中央领导集体提出实现中华民族伟大复兴的中国梦，带领13亿中国人民朝着实现“两个一百年”的奋斗目标迈进。这就是，到2020年全面建成小康社会，到本世纪中叶建成社会主义现代化国家。走过五千载岁月沧桑，历经一百年兴衰沉浮，当代中国站到了新的历史起点上。 <br><br>

未来的中国，将会坚持一条什么样的发展道路，奉行什么样的内外政策，发挥什么样的国际作用，相信这些问题都是国际社会非常关心的。作为新一届中国政府的外长，在这里我要郑重地告诉大家： <br><br>

中国将坚定不移地走和平发展道路。这些年来，随着中国的快速发展，国际上有人担心中国会不会走国富必骄、国强必霸的老路，各种中国威胁论层出不穷。但历史的旧版本已不能套用到中国的新画卷，冷战的旧思维更不应延续到全球化的新时代。中华民族热爱和平，中华文化崇尚和谐。自古以来，中国人热衷于对外交往通商，而不是对外侵略扩张，执着于保家卫国的爱国主义，而不是开疆拓土的殖民主义。 <br><br>

文化决定理念，历史昭示未来。 <br><br>

近40年前，就在这个讲坛上，中国领导人邓小平代表中国政府庄严宣告，中国永远不在世界上称王称霸。时至今日，这仍是我们不变的承诺，也是我们不渝的信念。无论过去、现在和将来，中国都重信守诺，都是维护世界和平的坚定力量。 <br><br>

中国身体力行地走和平发展道路，同时也主张世界各国共同走和平发展道路。改革开放以来，中国与世界经济日益相互依存，中国与国际体系日趋不可分割。我们主张共同建立以合作共赢为核心的新型国际关系，我们主张共同致力于以和平方式解决各种国际和地区争端。对于中国与一些国家之间存在的领土主权和海洋权益争端，我们真诚希望通过直接当事国的谈判协商妥善处理，一时解决不了的，可以先搁置起来。我们是这样说的，也是这样做的。同时，中国在任何时候都将坚定捍卫国家的主权和领土完整，坚定维护中国的正当与合法权益。 <br><br>

中国将坚定不移地继续改革开放和可持续发展。今年是国际金融危机爆发5周年，世界经济的列车行驶在复苏轨道上，但基础不牢固，速度不理想。金融危机的病根尚未消除，发达国家的结构性问题依旧存在。受外部非常规货币政策调整的冲击，加之其他因素，新兴市场国家面临新的挑战和金融市场动荡的压力。中国的经济走向也引起国际国内广泛关注。我要告诉大家的是，中国经济基本面良好，经济运行总体平稳，发展前景光明。目前，中国经济的各项重要指标普遍企稳向好，中国的经济增速在世界主要经济体中仍然保持着领先地位。 <br><br>

中国政府采取了兼顾当前和长远的宏观经济政策，坚持稳中求进，通过一系列创新性政策措施，积极地稳增长、调结构、促改革。我们大力推进改革开放，深化经济结构调整，加快转变发展方式。我们贯彻节约资源和保护环境的基本国策，着力推动绿色发展、循环发展、低碳发展，建设生态文明和美丽中国。 <br><br>

随着体量增大和发展转型，中国经济转入中高速增长符合经济规律，客观上也有利于中国经济的持续健康发展。中国经济正在建设“升级版”，未来发展有四大“红利”：一是工业化、信息化、新型城镇化和农业现代化的红利，二是改革创新的红利，三是结构调整的红利，四是进一步开放的红利。预计未来5年，中国将进口10万亿美元以上的商品，对外投资5000亿美元，出境旅游超过4亿人次。这将为世界经济注入更多活力，为各国人民带来更多实惠。 <br><br>

中国将坚定不移地推进以联合国为核心的全球治理体系变革。联合国是世界各国协商合作的大舞台，也是各国人民团结互助的大家庭。我们始终认为，《联合国宪章》的宗旨和原则是当代国际关系的基石，是世界和平安宁的保障。尊重各国主权、反对干涉内政，维护和平、反对侵略，促进平等、反对强权，这些重要的原则必须始终坚持。中国坚决维护联合国的地位和权威，支持联合国根据形势发展变化不断革新完善，期待联合国在国际事务中发挥更大作用。中国愿意深化同联合国的合作关系，更加积极地参与联合国各领域工作。 <br><br>

中国致力于国际关系民主化和世界多极化进程，主张增加广大发展中国家在国际治理体系中的代表性和话语权，支持二十国集团、金砖国家等新兴机制发挥更大作用，推动国际秩序朝着更加公正合理的方向发展。中国主张国际货币金融体系的改革，维护世贸组织的主渠道地位，反对贸易保护主义，推动经济全球化朝着均衡、普惠、共赢的方向发展。我们呼吁各国加强宏观经济政策协调，关注本国经济政策调整带来的外溢效应。我们主张加强南北对话和南南合作，让发展成果更好惠及各国人民。 <br><br>

中国将坚定不移地履行应尽的国际责任和义务。中华民族是勤于任事、勇于担当的民族。尽管中国还是发展中国家，发展任务仍十分艰巨，但作为世界第二大经济体和联合国安理会常任理事国，中国深知自己肩负的责任和国际社会的期待。 <br><br>

我们将更加积极、全面地参与国际事务，与各国紧密合作，携手应对各种纷繁复杂的全球性挑战，破解人类面临的各种难题。我们将发出中国声音，贡献中国智慧，提出中国方案，体现中国作用，努力为国际社会提供更多公共产品。 <br><br>

我们将大力弘扬正确的义利观，积极构建与发展中国家的命运共同体。在同发展中国家交往合作中，我们将坚持见利思义、义重于利，真心诚意地向发展中国家朋友提供力所能及的帮助，促进发展中国家实现自主和可持续发展。 <br><br>

 我们将更加主动、建设性地参与处理国际和地区热点问题，劝和促谈，消弭战端，维护世界的和平、稳定与安宁。我们将继续在亚丁湾开展护航和反海盗行动，并将进一步扩大参与联合国维和行动，为非洲等有关地区的和平与安全贡献更大力量。 <br><br>

主席先生， <br><br>

叙利亚陷入动荡已近三年，叙利亚人民和周边邻国承受了巨大的痛苦与创伤。特别是最近发生的使用化学武器事件，受到国际社会强烈谴责。中方坚决反对使用化学武器，期待安理会尽快通过决议，支持禁化武组织启动核查和销毁工作。我们愿为销毁叙化武向禁化武组织捐款并派出有关专家。中国呼吁叙利亚境内立即停火止暴，为核查销毁化武提供必要条件。中国主张尽早召开第二次日内瓦国际会议，加快推进叙利亚问题的政治解决。中国在叙利亚问题上没有私利，我们尊重叙利亚人民的意愿和选择。中方高度关注叙利亚人道主义状况，已经并将继续向叙利亚人民包括境外难民提供力所能及的援助。近期，中国正在落实对约旦提供的1500万元人民币的紧急人道主义物资援助，并将向世界粮食计划署和世界卫生组织提供2400多万元人民币紧急人道主义现汇援助，分别用于救助叙利亚境内的流离失所者和黎巴嫩境内的叙利亚难民。 <br><br>

在伊朗核问题上，中国从维护国际核不扩散体系和中东和平稳定的大局出发，一直积极劝和促谈，为推动伊朗核问题的全面、长期和妥善解决发挥着建设性作用。当前，六国与伊朗对话面临新机遇。有关各方应加大外交努力，推动对话及早取得实质进展。 <br><br>

巴勒斯坦问题是中东问题的核心。中方愿继续在习近平主席提出的解决巴勒斯坦问题四点主张的基础上，为全面、公正、持久解决巴勒斯坦问题做出积极贡献。 <br><br>

在有关各方共同努力下，朝鲜半岛局势近来有所缓和。实现朝鲜半岛无核化，维护半岛长久和平稳定，符合各方共同利益。中方始终认为，对话协商是解决半岛核问题的正确途径，六方会谈是推进半岛实现无核化的有效平台。今年是六方会谈启动十周年，中方希望各方创造条件，积累共识，相向而行，早日重启六方会谈。 <br><br>

主席先生，
 <br><br>
国际发展合作目前正处于承前启后的关键阶段。中国支持继续全面落实千年发展目标，同时尽快启动2015年后发展议程政府间谈判。2015年后发展议程应继续以发展为主题，以消除贫困为核心，统筹考虑各国不同的国情与发展阶段，尊重各国自主选择的发展道路。应重视加强全球发展伙伴关系，坚持“共同但有区别的责任”原则、公平原则以及各自能力原则，完善落实机制，增加发展筹资，促进贸易和投资自由化便利化，扩大对发展中国家的官方发展援助及技术支持。
 <br><br>
中方欢迎2012年底气候变化多哈会议取得的积极成果。中方希望发达国家拿出诚意、兑现承诺，进一步提高减排力度，并向发展中国家提供资金、技术及能力建设支持。中国政府高度重视气候变化问题，已为此采取了一系列强有力的政策措施，成绩显著。中方愿为应对全球气候变化继续做出贡献。
 <br><br>
主席先生，
 <br><br>
时光荏苒，岁月如梭，我们即将迎来联合国成立70周年。联合国诞生于二次世界大战的战火硝烟中，寄托着各国人民对维护世界和平、促进全球发展的热切期盼。中国梦是国家富强梦，人民幸福梦，与世界人民之梦息息相通。中国作为联合国负责任的一员，愿与各成员国一道，认真践行《联合国宪章》的宗旨，忠诚履行历史赋予的使命，为不断推进人类和平与发展的崇高事业而不懈努力。

China at a New Starting Point<br><br>

MISSION TO THE UNITED NATIONS<br><br>

PRESS RELEASE<br><br>
(Translation)<br><br>
China at a New Starting Point<br><br>
Statement by H.E. Mr. Wang Yi<br><br>
Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China<br><br>
At the General Debate of the 68th Session of The United Nations General Assembly <br><br>
New York, 27 September 2013 <br><br>
Mr. President, <br><br>
This year has been an unusual one in China's development. China's new central collective leadership has put forward the concept Of the Chinese dream of the great renewal of the Chinese nation. And it is leading the 1.3 billion Chinese people in an endeavor to fulfill the two centenary goals, namely, to finish building a moderately prosperous society in all respects by 2020 and to turn China into a modern socialist country by the mid-21st century. Having experienced profound changes in the past five thousand years and especially the past century, China has reached a new historical starting point today. <br><br>
What development path will China take in the future? What domestic and foreign policies will it pursue? And what kind of international role will it play? I understand that these questions are of great interest to the international community. As the foreign minister of the new Chinese government, I wish to give an emphatic answer to them. <br><br>
China will stay firmly on the path of peaceful development. China's rapid development over the years has given rise to worries that China might follow the old pattern of wealth breeding arrogance and strength leading to hegemony; and various versions of the China threat theory have surfaced. However, what happened in the past should not be applied to today's China. The outdated Cold-War mentality has no place in the new era of globalization. The Chinese nation loves peace and the Chinese culture values harmony. In history, the Chinese people have always embraced international exchanges and trade, not foreign aggression and expansion, and adhered to the patriotic resolve to defend the homeland rather than the colonialist doctrine to seize new territories. <br><br>
The culture of a country determines its values, and its history points the way to its future. <br><br>
Close to 40 years ago, it was on this podium that the Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping solemnly declared on behalf of the Chinese government that China would never seek hegemony in the world. Today, his statement remains our unchanging commitment and conviction. China has honored and will continue to honor its promise and remain a staunch force for upholding world peace. <br><br>
China pursues peaceful development and calls on all other countries to follow the same path. Since the beginning of reform and opening up, China has become increasingly interdependent with the global economy and integrated into the international system. We are committed to working with others to establish a new type of international relations based on win-win cooperation and seek peaceful resolution of international and regional disputes. With regard to China's disputes with some countries over territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests, we sincerely hope to properly resolve them through negotiation and consultation with countries directly involved. Those disputes that cannot be resolved now can be shelved for future resolution. This is our consistent position and practice. On the other hand, we will, under whatever circumstances, firmly safeguard China's sovereignty and territorial integrity and resolutely uphold China's legitimate and lawful rights and interests. <br><br>
China will remain committed to reform, opening up and sustainable development. It has been five years since the outbreak of the international financial crisis. Global economy is back on the right track to recovery, but the foundation of the recovery is not solid and the speed is not fast enough. The root causes of the financial crisis are yet to be removed, and the structural problems of developed countries remain unresolved. The adjustment of unconventional monetary policies from the outside, coupled with other factors, have posed new challenges and the risk of financial market volatility to emerging market countries. Where the Chinese economy is heading engages domestic as well as international attention. Here, I wish to tell everyone that both the fundamentals and the overall performance of China's economy are sound, and China's development prospects are bright. The leading indicators of the Chinese economy are generally good, and China leads the major economies in growth rate. <br><br>
In pursuit of progress while maintaining stability, the Chinese government has taken a macro-economic policy that addresses both immediate and long-term needs and adopted a series of innovative policy measures with a view to ensuring steady growth, adjusting economic structure and promoting reform. We are vigorously advancing reform and opening up, deepening economic structural adjustment, and accelerating the shift in our growth model. We are implementing the basic state policy of resource conservation and environment protection and promoting green, circular and low-carbon development to build a sound ecology and a beautiful China.  <br><br>
As China grows in economic output and changes its growth model, its economy has entered a phase of high-to-medium growth rate. This is dictated by the law of economics, and it will ensure sustained and healthy growth of the Chinese economy. The Chinese economy is being upgraded, and its future growth will deliver four major dividends, namely, dividends released by industrialization, IT application, a new type of urbanization and agricultural modernization, by reform and innovation, by structural readjustment, and by further opening-up. It is projected that in the coming five years, China's imports of commodities will exceed US$10 trillion, its overseas investment will reach US$500 billion, and Chinese tourists will make over 400 million outbound visits. This will give stronger impetus to the world economy and bring more tangible benefits to other countries. <br><br>
China will firmly promote reform of the global governance system with the United Nations at its core. The United Nations is a big stage for all countries to conduct consultation and cooperation with one other. It is also a big family where people of all countries are brought together. It is our consistent position that the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations form the cornerstone of current international relations and provide safeguards for world peace and stability. Respecting national sovereignty and opposing interference in internal affairs, safeguarding peace and opposing aggression, and promoting equality and opposing power politics -- these important principles must be observed. China firmly upholds the role and authority of the United Nations, supports the United Nations in renewing and improving itself in keeping with a changing world, and looks forward to a United Nations that plays a bigger role in international affairs. China is ready to deepen cooperation with the United Nations and get more actively involved in UN activities in various fields. <br><br>
China is committed to promoting democracy in international relations and the trend toward a multi-polar world. China calls for greater representation and voice of developing countries in the global governance system, and supports the G20, the BRICS and other emerging mechanisms in playing a big role so as to make the international order fairer and more equitable. China calls for reforming the international monetary and financial systems and upholding the role of the World Trade Organization as the main channel. We are opposed to trade protectionism and are working to make economic globalization more balanced, inclusive and beneficial to all. We call on countries to enhance macro-economic policy coordination and be mindful of the spill-over effects of their respective adjustment of economic policies. We call for strengthening North-South dialogue and South-South cooperation to make development benefits more accessible to people of all countries. <br><br>
China will firmly fulfill its due international responsibilities and obligations. The Chinese nation is responsible and ready to play its part. Although it remains a developing country facing a daunting task of development, China, as the second biggest economy and a permanent member of the UN Security Council, is fully aware of its responsibilities and expectations placed on it by the international community. <br><br>
We will be fully and more actively engaged in international affairs and work closely with other countries to meet complex global challenges and tackle difficult issues facing mankind. We will voice China's views, offer China's wisdom, propose China's solutions, play China's due role and provide more public goods to the international community. <br><br>
We will vigorously advocate the right vision on justice versus interests and endeavor to build a community of common destiny with other developing countries. In our exchanges and cooperation with other developing countries, we will uphold justice and place it above interests, and give sincere assistance to other developing countries to the best of our ability so as to enable developing countries to realize independent and sustainable development. <br><br>
We will play a more proactive and constructive role in addressing international and regional hotspot issues to promote peace and dialogue, defuse conflicts and safeguard world peace and stability. We will continue with our escort missions and counter-piracy operations in the Gulf of Aden, and increase participation in the UN peacekeeping operations so as to contribute more to peace and security in Africa and other relevant regions. <br><br>
Mr. President, <br><br>
Turmoil in Syria has lasted for nearly three years, causing great suffering and trauma to both the Syrian people and Syria's neighbors. The recent use of chemical weapons has met universal condemnation. China firmly opposes the use of chemical weapons. We hope to see an early adoption of a UN Security Council resolution to support the OPCW in launching the verification and destruction of chemical weapons and we stand ready to make financial contribution to the OPCW for the destruction of chemical weapons in Syria. China calls for an immediate end to hostilities and violence in Syria so as to create necessary conditions for the verification and destruction of chemical weapons. We call for the early convening of the Geneva II conference and faster progress in a political resolution of the Syrian issue. China seeks no self gains in Syria and does not take side on the Syrian issue. We respect the aspirations and choice of the Syrian people. China follows the humanitarian situation in Syria with great concern. We have provided and will continue to provide assistance within our means to the Syrian people, including Syrian refugees outside the country. <br><br>
Recently, China has been implementing emergency humanitarian material aid to Jordan worth RMB15 million, and has provided emergency humanitarian aid in cash worth RMB24 million to the World Food Program and the World Health Organization for the displaced people within Syria and Syrian refugees in Lebanon respectively. <br><br>
On the Iranian nuclear issue, China has been working to promote a peaceful settlement through dialogue. We have played a constructive role in seeking a comprehensive, lasting and appropriate solution to the Iranian nuclear issue so as to uphold the international non-proliferation regime and peace and stability in the Middle East. The dialogue between the P5+l and Iran has created new opportunities. All the relevant parties should scale up diplomatic efforts and work for substantive progress in the dialogue at an early date. <br><br>
The Palestinian issue is at the core of the Middle East conflict. Guided by President Xi Jinping's four-point proposal on resolving the Palestinian issue, China will continue to work for a comprehensive, just and durable solution to the issue.
Thanks to the concerted efforts of all the relevant parties, that tension on the Korean Peninsula is easing. To achieve denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and maintain long-term peace and stability on the Peninsula meets the common interests of all parties concerned. It is China's consistent position that a negotiated solution through dialogue is the right way to solve the nuclear issue on the Peninsula, and the Six-Party Talks are an effective platform to promote denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula. This year marks the 10th anniversary of the launch of the Six-Party Talks. We hope that parties will create conditions, build consensus, work toward the same goal, and resume the Talks at an early date. <br><br>
Mr. President, <br><br>
International development cooperation is at a crucial stage where we must build on past achievements to make new progress. China supports the continued and full implementation of the Millennium Development Goals and the early launch of inter-governmental negotiations on the post-2015 development agenda. The post-2015 development agenda should continue to focus on development and poverty elimination, give due consideration to national conditions and stages of development in different countries, and respect their independent choices of development paths. The agenda should give priority to strengthening global development partnerships, adhere to the principles of common but differentiated responsibilities, equity and respective capabilities, improve follow-up mechanisms, step up development financing, promote trade and investment liberalization and facilitation, and increase official development aid and technical support to developing countries. <br><br>
China welcomes the positive outcomes of the Doha Climate Change Conference held at the end of 2012. China hopes that developed countries will demonstrate political will and honor their commitments by scaling up emissions reduction efforts and providing capital, technology and capacity-building support to developing countries. The Chinese government takes climate change seriously, and the host of forceful policy measures it has taken have resulted in notable progress. China will continue to play its due role in addressing global climate change. <br><br>
Mr. President, <br><br>
Time flie!! We will soon be celebrating the 70th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations. Born out of the ashes of the Second World War, the United Nations embodies the yearning of peoples of all countries for world peace and global development. The Chinese dream is a dream about China's prosperity and Chinese people's happiness, which has much in common with the dream of people across the world. As a responsible member of the United Nations, China is ready to work with all other member states to faithfully adhere to the purposes of the UN Charter, fully carry out its historic mission, and continue to make relentless efforts to advance the noble cause of peace and development for mankind. <br><br>
